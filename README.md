# **My School of Code Mini-Journal**

In addition to daily notetaking, I made this week-by-week journal of my experience at the [School of Code Bootcamp](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) (Apr–Aug 2022). The aim was for this document to serve as both a useful quick summary for personal reflection and as a potentially useful resource for future School of Code students.

I have also been tweeting about my #100DaysofCode challenge throughout this process. These tweets can be found on my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/simonisworking) or in [this Github repo](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/100daysofcode).

### _Course Content_:
* Intro to SoC ethos, computational thinking and problem solving
* Practice collaborating with Git/Github
* Practice with CSS positioning and flexbox
* Intro to JavaScript, including:
    * Data types, variables, and functions
    * Logic flow and console logging
    * Objects, arrays, and for/while loops

* Hackathon #1 - Make a Rock, Paper, Scissors game - [view here](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/rock-paper-scissors-game)
* Recap tasks - Finish workshops and practice Codewars

### _Personal Reflections_:
Really enjoyed this introductory week, meeting some of the other students, and getting familiar with the JS basics.

I also met my mentor Piper for the first time, who was really friendly and engaged, and will no doubt be a huge help throughout.

I particularly love that SoC are emphasizing and addressing the mental health side of learning to code, and giving plenty of advice on how to work successfully and empathetically with others. 

The Friday Hackathon really brought together the week's learning well. Our hackathon can be [viewed here](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/rock-paper-scissors-game).

## Week 2 - 2nd-6th May 2022
### _Theme_
"**Fundamentals of Programming with JavaScript**" - Getting up to speed with the JS language & interacting with APIs

### _Programming partner_
Ismail Ali

### _Course Content_:
* Intro to HTML DOM (Document Object Model) modification
* Asynchronous functions and APIs
* Using the Fetch API
* Second mindset session with Joseph Trodden, including:
    * Myers-Briggs personality types
    * How to relate to others and work together productively
* Guest speakers:
    * Former bootcampers now working at [Wise](https://withwise.com/)

### _Paired-programming workshops_:
* DOM manipulation - Creating, selecting, and changing elements
* Events - Using event listeners
* Fetch - Fetching from Kanye API through an 'on click' event
* DOM Fetch - Fetch API practice game: [Earth Escape](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2090159/TzRLkAk8)
* Navigating Data - Navigating APIs to select certain data
* Rock-Paper-Scissors DOM Edition - Recreating our RPS game in the DOM
* Hackathon #2 - Practicing fetch requests using the PokeAPI - [view here](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/pokemon-api-game)
* Recap tasks - Various repeats of this week’s tasks, including tests to pass on Github

### _Personal Reflections_:
The syntax and functions used for DOM manipulation took a little getting used to, but it felt really powerful to finally be making changes that were reflected what was displayed on screen.

The PokeAPI hackathon was a blast, and Ismail and I were really proud of the little Pokemon guessing game we built, despite hitting stumbling blocks along the way. Our hackathon can be [viewed here](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/pokemon-api-game).

I had my second meeting with mentor Piper, where we discussed time management, how to prevent timewasting when problem solving, and appropriate work levels outside of the bootcamp.
