# **My Coding Mini-Journal**

In addition to daily notetaking, I made this week-by-week journal of my experience at the [School of Code Bootcamp](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) (Aprâ€“Aug 2022). The aim was for this document to serve as a useful quick summary for both personal reflection and as a potentially useful resource for future School of Code students.

I have also been tweeting about my #100DaysofCode challenge throughout this process. These tweets can be found on my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/simonisworking) or in [this Github repo](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/100daysofcode).

### _Personal Reflection_:
Really enjoyed this introductory week, meeting some of the other students, and getting familiar with the JS basics.

I particularly love that SoC are emphasizing and addressing the mental health side of learning to code, and giving plenty of advice on how to work successfully and empathetically with others. 

The Friday Hackathon really brought together the week's learning well. Our hackathon project can be [viewed here](https://github.com/simonpartridge86/rock-paper-scissors-game).
